THE BYTECODE
- The key that allows Java to solve both the security and the portability problems just described
is that the output of a Java compiler is not executable code. Rather, it is bytecode. Bytecode is
a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the Java run-time system,
which is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In essence, the original JVM was designed as
an interpreter for bytecode.

-Java also supports Remote Method Invocation (RMI). This feature enables a program to
invoke methods across a network.
