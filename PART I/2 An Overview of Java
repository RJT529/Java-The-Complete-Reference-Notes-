OOP

-Object-oriented programming organizes a program around its data (that is,
objects) and a set of well-defined interfaces to that data.
[a data controlling access to code.]

Abstraction: emphasising on essential things

THREE OOP PRINIPLE:

1. Encapsulation:
-Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and
keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
-objects are sometimes referred to as instances of a class
-The data defined by the class are referred to as member variables or instance variables. 
-The code that operates on that data is referred to as member methods or just methods.

2. Inheritance:
-Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object.
-supports the concept of hierarchical classification

3. Polymorphism:
-allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.
-one interface, multiple methods
